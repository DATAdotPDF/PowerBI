<p align="left">Hey there! <br>Welcome to my Power BI Projects repository. This is a space where I share some of the dashboards and reports I’ve built using Power BI — most of them created for personal projects or as part of my learning journey. You’ll find a mix of data visualizations, from simple insights to more complex reports, all designed to be engaging and easy to follow.<br><br>The goal here is to keep learning, share my process, and hopefully inspire others along the way. Whether you’re diving into Power BI yourself or just curious about how data can be presented, I hope you find something useful or interesting.<br><br>Feel free to explore, adapt, or reach out if you want to chat or collaborate. Enjoy!</p>
